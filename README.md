# Exercise-3d-Shaders

Implemented everything demonstrated in video tutorials. Tweaked shader background to be green themed for main menu, and added shaders as a background for in-game and end screen. In-game background has larger rectangles and is darker and gray to be less distracting. End screen background is red themed for game over. Added main menu music to in-game levels. Added new additional music for end screen. Updated paddle sound effect. Increased particle emission. Reduced screen shake effect. 

All music and sound effects are made by me.
